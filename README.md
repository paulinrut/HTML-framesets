# HTML-framesets
Hello, this is my attempt in studying web programming.

Basically, I took the layout from here (https://github.com/ahmadaqib/-Frameset-.git) 
and added some adjustments that suited my studying needs.
those changes including; adding colors, inserting hyperlink, and using target.

Hope it is useful to those who needs, as the one from previous/original one has been very helpful.
